# Handwritten Text Generator

## Overview
The Handwritten Text Generator is a deep learning project that aims to generate realistic handwritten-style text using the DeepWriting dataset. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn the patterns of human handwriting and produce text that closely resembles actual handwritten notes.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Efficiently loads and preprocesses the DeepWriting dataset, including image normalization and resizing.
- **Character Mapping**: Converts characters to integer sequences for model training and vice versa for text generation.
- **Model Architecture**: Implements a CNN-RNN hybrid model to capture the sequential nature of handwriting.
- **Text Generation**: Generates handwritten text based on input strings, mimicking human writing styles.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib


```

### Install Dependencies
You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Download the DeepWriting dataset and place it in the specified directory.
2. **Run the Model**: Execute the main script to train the model and generate handwritten text.
   ```bash
   python handwritten_text_generator.py
   ```
3. **Generate Handwritten Text**: Modify the input text in the script to generate different handwritten samples.

## Example
After training the model, you can generate handwritten text by providing an input string. For example:
```python
input_text = "Hello, World!"
generated_text = generate_handwriting(model, input_text, char_to_int, int_to_char)
print("Generated Handwritten Text:", generated_text)
```

## Evaluation
The generated text is evaluated based on its coherence, readability, and visual similarity to actual handwritten text. User studies can be conducted to gather qualitative feedback on the realism of the generated samples.
